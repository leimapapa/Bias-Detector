# Bias-Detector
The intent is to use scientific papers on bias in writing to identify ways to detect and measure bias on a scale.
The main source so far is this research paper from Stanford, located here:https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/pubs/neutrality.pdf
TensorFlow.js will be useful to automatically identify bias based on parameterized cues passed into tensors
